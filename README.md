Overview: This project implements a distance measurement system using the ATmega32 microcontroller and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. The system accurately measures distances and displays them on an LCD screen in real-time.
Specifications:
1.	Microcontroller: ATmega32 operating at a frequency of 8MHz.
2.	Distance Measurement: Utilizes the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure distances.
3.	Sensor Interface: Refer to the "HC-SR04 Ultrasonic MT Student Tutorial" PDF file for interfacing instructions.
4.	LCD Display: Displays the measured distance in real-time.
